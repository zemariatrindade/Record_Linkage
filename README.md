Project name: CrossStore Product Matching Initiative
Project Goal: The CrossStore Product Matching Initiative aims to identify overlapping products between two large-scale department store chains, enabling the implementation of cross-promotion strategies, product indexing, and targeted marketing campaigns.

Data Sources:
- Product description datasets from Retailer A and Retailer B

Technologies and Tools:
- nltk library modules for data cleaning
- tfidf and cosine similarity for entity matching
- HDBSCAN for entity clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for visualization

Actions:
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Gain an overview of the datasets to determine the best strategy for clustering products across retailers.
- Utilize nltk library modules for data cleaning, including the removal of stopwords and tokenization of documents/sentences or paragraphs.
- Entity Matching: Employ tfidf and cosine similarity techniques to match products across the datasets.
- Entity Clustering: Utilize HDBSCAN for clustering similar entities.
- Visualization with PCA.
