Project Goal: Identify products in Retailer B's dataset that also exist in Retailer A's dataset for cross-promotion, product indexing, and targeted marketing purposes.

Data Sources:
- Product descriptions datasets from Retailer A and Retailer B

Technologies and Tools:
- nltk library modules for data cleaning
- tfidf and cosine similarity for entity matching
- HDBSCAN for entity clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for visualization

Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Gain an overview of the datasets to determine the best strategy for clustering products across retailers.
Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Utilize nltk library modules for data cleaning, including the removal of stopwords and tokenization of documents/sentences or paragraphs.
Entity Matching:
- Employ tfidf and cosine similarity techniques to match products across the datasets.
Entity Clustering:
- Utilize HDBSCAN for clustering similar entities.
Visualization with PCA:
- Visualize the clustered entities using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for enhanced understanding and interpretation.
